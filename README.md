# E-commerce Site

This project was to create an E-commerce website which would act and look
similar to the website [Shein](https://ca.shein.com/)

I used a minimalistic color pallete to add importance to items and UI
elements.

### Filter & Sort

Ability to filter items by minimum and maximum prices as well as a minimum star rating.

Ability to sort through clothing categories via a dropdown menu with the categories being: All, Electronics, Jewelery, Men's Clothing, and Women's Clothing.

### Cart & Bookmark

The user can add items to their cart and increase or decrease the items quantity from the cart, which will automatically calculate the customers order total.

The user has the ability to add items to your bookmarks for later and while browsing your bookmarks you can easily add bookmarked items to your cart.
